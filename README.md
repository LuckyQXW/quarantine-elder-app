# Grocery Recording App
This is a simple React web app used to record a grocery list, a simple demo
accompanying the HelperVille app we designed for seniors in quarantine.

## How to Interact
Press the mic, then say "I want to buy groceries"
Then you can say individual items in the grocery list, like 3 tomatoes,
4 bananas, 5 avocados, etc. Have a slight pause in between so the speech
recognition add that item as a separate list item.
Finally, you can say I am done and it will say your list is recorded. Yay!

## Future Steps
Integrate DialogueFlow API on the Google Cloud Platform so the chatbot is a bit
more intelligent. Still need to figure out the getting the OAuth credentials
and building out the whole conversation, as well as speak out the response as
they come back.
